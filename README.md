## ⛓️ Prerequisites

- `node.js` version 18.18 or newer
- a package manager like `yarn`, `pnpm` or `npm` (this app was developed using `npm`)

## 🏁 Getting Started

Install dependencies by running `npm i` in the project root.

```bash
npm i
```

Run the following command to start the app in dev mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open the app: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📚 What next?

Once you have started the app, you will see two columns, one labelled "Your results" the other "Tasks". Your code should be placed inside [src/components/common/tasks.tsx](./src/components/common/tasks.tsx).

Good luck and happy hacking! 🍀🧑‍💻
